# Upstream provenance & sync ledger

Tracks exactly which upstream pi the Go port corresponds to, and the
commit-by-commit sync pipeline that keeps it current.

- **Upstream**: https://github.com/earendil-works/pi (TypeScript, by Mario Zechner)
- **This port started**: 2026-06-08 (cloned upstream `main` HEAD of the day)

## Current pin

| What | Value |
|---|---|
| TS source fully reviewed/ported | `29c1504c` — "chore: approve contributor dodiego" (2026-06-17); previous pins `f8a77f47` (06-16), `93b3b7c1` (06-14), `6f29450e` (06-13) |
| npm build the byte-goldens were captured from | `@earendil-works/pi-ai` **0.79.6** (request goldens re-verified 12/12 — 6 standard + GLM-5.2 xhigh/off/minimal/low — against the 0.79.6 build); `pi-coding-agent` 0.78.1 (session/image goldens — unaffected by 0.79.x) |
| Parity proofs at the pin | requests 12/12 · session tree 8/8 · image decisions 8/8 byte/decision-identical |
| Reviewed via | initial port + parity sweep 1 + parity sweep 2 (`3be3911`), registration fix (`b09cb46`) |

Deliberately not ported (out of scope for the ledger unless a commit changes
that decision): TUI, extensions runtime, OAuth token acquisition, project-trust
gating, Bedrock/Vertex/Mistral/Azure/Codex providers, image generation, bun/CLI
packaging, prompt-templates, settings-manager, config migrations,
agent-session-runtime (session reload + /new flow), and the host-side machinery
that *populates* provider-scoped env overrides (resolve-config-value,
model-registry, settings) — the SDK `StreamOptions.Env` field is ported but
stays latent until a host sets it (see the 2026-06-17 ruling).

### Rulings (answers to `decide` escalations — triage must not re-ask)

- **2026-06-17 — provider-scoped env overrides ported faithfully** (re:
  `7f29e7a3`). Owner call: maximum parity. `StreamOptions.Env`
  (`map[string]string`) is consulted ahead of `os.Getenv` (helper
  `getProviderEnvValue`: non-empty scoped value wins, empty falls through —
  pi's `||`) for the two ported consumers pi touches: `PI_CACHE_RETENTION` and
  Cloudflare base-URL placeholders, across anthropic/openai-completions/
  openai-responses. pi's `getBunSandboxEnvValue` `/proc/self/environ` fallback
  is DELIBERATELY OMITTED — it works around oven-sh/bun#27802 (Bun compiled
  binaries expose an empty `process.env` in Linux sandboxes), a runtime defect
  Go does not have. The host-side population machinery stays unported (field
  latent, matching pi SDK consumers that don't populate it). Future commits to
  the env-override *plumbing in ported providers* are `port`; commits only to
  the unported host-side population are `n/a`.

- **2026-06-16 — provider-attribution ported faithfully** (port-it ruling); SDK
  sends pi's default attribution headers (http-referer/x-title/...) on the
  providers pi does.

- **2026-06-12 — project trust stays excluded** (re: `718215bd`, `d8aef0fe`,
  and the wider upstream trust push). Criteria set by the owner: not an SDK
  use case (host apps control what loads), postponable (purely additive
  subsystem), and verified not to change behavior of ported surface (the only
  ported-adjacent diff was a behavior-neutral refactor inside the unported
  extension resource-loader; `skills.ts` untouched). Future trust commits are
  `n/a` under this ruling UNLESS they change behavior of surface we ported —
  that re-escalates.

## Drift at last sync check (2026-06-17)

**Caught up to `29c1504c`.** Ledger f8a77f47 → 29c1504c fully processed (20
main-line changes: 3 ported, 16 n/a, 1 decide resolved). Two release tags
crossed (v0.79.5, v0.79.6); npm reference build advanced 0.79.4 → 0.79.6.
Reviewed via independent go-review (ship) + adversarial parity review
(4/4 faithful; request diff regenerated from the 0.79.6 build, 12/12 — 6
standard + the 4 new GLM-5.2 scenarios; null-content regression test
mutation-verified non-vacuous).

- Ports: `75b0d723` (Z.AI GLM-5.2 native reasoning_effort — `788c832`),
  `2d597f02` (null Responses content — `e8f7511`, no code change: Go ranges a
  nil slice safely; locked with a regression test), and `31bfb2f1` (catalog →
  npm 0.79.6 — `c2221a7`, subsumes the v0.79.5 catalog + the deepseek-v4 compat
  / cost / maxTokens data churn `2431491c`/`bd9f8773`/`7da475db`).
- **Deferred data landed:** the 0.79.6 catalog ships `off:null` for Kimi K2.7
  Code (`moonshotai`/`moonshotai-cn`, incl. `-highspeed`), activating the
  deepseek disabled-thinking gate ported on 2026-06-15 (`62fa1e3`). The
  `TestDeepseekCatalogNoOffNull` tripwire is now `TestDeepseekDisabledThinkingGateLive`,
  driving the omit end-to-end through the catalog-resolved model.
- **Decide → ruling:** provider-scoped env overrides **ported faithfully**
  (`7f29e7a3` → `872c303`; owner call 2026-06-17, recorded in Rulings).
  `StreamOptions.Env` consulted ahead of `os.Getenv`; Bun `/proc` fallback
  omitted (no Go analog); host-side population machinery stays unported.

### Prior — 93b3b7c1 → f8a77f47 (2026-06-16)

**Caught up to `f8a77f47`.** Ledger 93b3b7c1 → f8a77f47 fully processed (20
main-line changes: 6 ported, 14 n/a, 1 decide resolved). Reviewed via an
adversarial multi-agent workflow: 5/6 parity-faithful + go-review pass +
request diff 6/6 against the 0.79.4 build; the review caught a real attribution
header-precedence divergence (model.Headers must override the attribution
defaults — pi merges them at the bottom of the stack) which was fixed and
re-verified. Shipped as v0.2.2.

- Ports: `0be5bb6c` (anthropic 1h cache-write cost = 2× input), `3fa40956`
  (bash stdout drain past exit — re-armed idle grace), `0369bdb8` (deepseek
  off:null thinking gate — logic; catalog data deferred), `b0c8f65f`
  (gemini-flash-latest alias → MINIMAL thinking — logic; data deferred),
  `bba6af2c` (catalog → npm 0.79.4), and `f8a77f47` + the `provider-attribution`
  module (see ruling).
- **Decide → ruling:** provider-attribution **ported faithfully** (owner call,
  2026-06-16). The SDK now sends pi's attribution headers on the providers pi
  does, gated on `PI_TELEMETRY` (default enabled), at the bottom of the header
  precedence so `model.Headers`/`opts.Headers` override them. Closed a
  pre-existing header parity gap the body-diff never covered.

### Prior — 6f29450e → 93b3b7c1 (2026-06-14)

**Caught up to `93b3b7c1` — no-op cycle (pin advance only, no version bump).**
Ledger 6f29450e → 93b3b7c1: 12 main-line changes, **0 ported, 12 n/a, 0
escalations**. Nothing touched ported behavior code (TUI, packaging/self-update,
extension package-manager, config-migrations/settings, docs/meta/examples). No
release tag in the window, so the npm reference build stays at `pi-ai` 0.79.3
and all goldens are unaffected. **Deferred catalog note:** `21a904f4` flips
`supportsLongCacheRetention:false` for 6 opencode models in generate-models —
the *behavior* is already ported (`openai_compat.go` + `openai.go`), so it's
pure catalog data that will land with the next release regen (no npm build ships
it yet). No code change → no tag; v0.2.1 remains the latest release.

### Prior — 3f44d3e2 → 6f29450e (2026-06-13)

**Caught up to `6f29450e`.** Ledger 3f44d3e2 → 6f29450e fully processed (22
main-line changes: 4 ported, 18 n/a, 0 escalations). Reviewed via an adversarial
multi-agent workflow: 4/4 parity-faithful, idiomatic go-review pass, request
diff 6/6 against the 0.79.3 build, completeness critic mutation-tested every
ported change (each fix is load-bearing). Shipped as v0.2.1.

- Ports: `a455f62f` (anthropic refusal details), `1fc80f4f` (resolve fallback
  Reasoning flip), `daab056a` (agent late-tool-update guard), `f2585c4c`
  (catalog → npm 0.79.3).
- **Fable-5 disabled-thinking gate went LIVE.** The 0.79.3 catalog ships
  `off:null` for `claude-fable-5` (anthropic + cloudflare-ai-gateway + bedrock
  variants), activating the latent 9ccfcd7c gate ported on 2026-06-12. The
  former latency tripwire is now `TestFable5DisabledThinkingGateLive`, which
  drives the omit behavior end-to-end through the catalog-resolved model and
  fails loudly if a future regen drops `off:null`.

### Prior — 130ae577 → 3f44d3e2 (2026-06-12)

**Caught up.** Ledger 130ae577 → 3f44d3e2 fully processed (52 main-line
changes: 9 ported, 43 n/a, 0 open). Releases v0.79.0 + v0.79.1 ingested; the
9ccfcd7c disabled-thinking gate is latent pending upstream's next catalog
regen (tripwire: TestFable5DisabledThinkingGateLive).

## Sync pipeline

Runs as a daily job — the `/pi-sync` skill (`.claude/skills/pi-sync/`)
orchestrates one cycle over everything upstream added since the pin. Each
ledger row is one main-line change (a PR merge carries its full PR diff,
`git diff <sha>^1..<sha>`). Stages, each owned by a dedicated skill:

1. **Triage** (`/pi-triage`) — WHY/WHAT from the real diff, then a SCOPE
   verdict: `port` / `n/a` (with reason) / `decide` (boundary changes are
   escalated to a human, never decided silently).
2. **Port** — each in-scope change lands as an individual Go commit
   referencing the upstream sha (`port(<area>): <subject> (upstream <sha>)`).
3. **Idiomatic review** (`/pi-go-review`) — independent agent verifies the
   port is real Go, not transliterated TypeScript.
4. **Parity review** (`/pi-parity-review`) — independent adversarial agent
   verifies faithfulness against the TS source AND the published npm build
   (build wins on drift); regenerates goldens from the build, never by hand;
   re-runs the differential request diff when provider request code changed.
5. **Gate + record** — full build/vet/`-race` suite green; ledger row filled
   (status, Go commit, notes); pin advanced; pushed.

The reviewers are independent of the porter by design: every parity bug this
project has shipped was pinned in place by the author's own tests and caught
only by comparison against real pi.

Upstream reference clone: `$PI_UPSTREAM_DIR`, default `~/.cache/pi-upstream`.
When the delta crosses a release tag, the npm reference build is refreshed to
that version before parity review.

Headers byte-exact: OpenRouter `HTTP-Referer:https://pi.dev`/`X-OpenRouter-Title:pi`/`X-OpenRouter-Categories:cli-agent`; NVIDIA `X-BILLING-INVOKE-ORIGIN:Pi`; Cloudflare `User-Agent:pi-coding-agent`; Vercel `http-referer:https://pi.dev`/`x-title:pi`; OpenCode session `x-opencode-session`/`x-opencode-client:pi`.

Scope-hint is a mechanical pre-classification from touched paths
(`review` = touches packages/{ai,agent,coding-agent}/src outside unported
areas; `likely-n/a` = TUI/docs/unported only). The pipeline's SCOPE step is
the real decision.
